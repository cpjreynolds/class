# Walker Essay

## Introduction

What makes you, you? This is a question that will never be answered, at least in an empirically
conclusive manner: what makes you more than the sum of your parts? Is it the brain, source of
cognitive faculties; morality, our sense of right and wrong; or is it 37.2 trillion cells working
in some semblance of unison; the list could go on, each argument with its merits and flaws.

In "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding", John Locke argues that personal identity is rooted
in psychological continuity, not the matter that one is comprised of.

Walker puts forth an alternative theory of personal identity, rather than attempting to define the
intangible, she argues that one's identity can be found in their works, in what they would leave
behind.

## Thesis

In her essay, "In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens", Alice Walker seeks to answer the question of
personal identity from without rather than within; by examining what we do, instead of what we
are, Walker presents a theory of personal identity based on one's works, not one's ego.

## Locke Paragraph

### Topic Sentence

The crux of the Lockean theory of personal identity rests on psychological continuity, one's
continuity of consciousness - maintained in memory - from one period of time to another.

### Body

The requirement for personhood is that of a contiguous memory, a psychological continuity, between
temporal periods, i.e., yesterday and today. If there exists a continuity of consciousness between
a person 'A' yesterday, and a person 'B' today, they are the same person; as argued by Locke in "An
Essay Concerning Human Understanding":

    "as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past action or thought,
    so far reaches the identity of that person; it is the same self now it was then;
    and it is by the same self with this present one that now reflects on it,
    that that action was done."

## Personal Identity from One's Works.

Karl Benz was the inventor of the modern automobile; his creation has shaped the globe in a manner
he could never have forseen. Yet despite the ubiquity of his achievement, you would be hard-pressed
to find an "average person" who could tell you who invented the automobile. Karl Benz's identity
lives on in his work.

## Notes

Personal identity from your memory persisting in others.
