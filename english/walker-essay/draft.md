# Walker Essay

## Question

What does Alice Walker's essay, "In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens" reveal about the relationship
between ancestry and creativity?

## Introduction

Creativity, responsible for thundering symphonies, impassioned prose, and wondrous works of art, to
name but a few; the Rachmaninoffs, Nabokovs, and Warhols of the world continue to inspire and awe
with their works. The sheer brilliance of their creations begs the question: wherein lies one's
artistry, this *creative spark*?

## Thesis

In her essay, "In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens", Alice Walker argues that the source of
creativity is not a question of nature but of nurture; the *creative spark* found within oneself is
not the product of cosmic coincidence but rather the manifestation of one's upbringing and its
influencing factors.

## Paragraph 1: Historical views on creativity

### Topic Sentence

Perceptions of the concept creativity have been varied throughout history;
philosophers have long debated both its provenance and existence.

### Body

In ancient Greece, there did not exist any words to describe the concept of creativity, or that of
creation itself; ancient Greek culture believed that artists
"do not make new things but merely imitate things that are in nature." (Tatarkiewicz, 244).

This is further demonstrated by the Classical Greek philosopher Plato: "'Will we say of a painter
that he makes something?' asked Plato in *The Republic*, and answered: 'Certainly not, he merely
imitates.'" (Tatarkiewicz, 244).

It was not until the Enlightenment Era - during which empiricist philosopher David Hume wrote
on the human mind and creativity in his seminal work,
"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" - that the origins of creativity were explored.

Hume argued that the mind, while seemingly unbounded in its capacity for abstract thought and
imaginings, is in fact limited in its capabilities. Hume asserts that "all this creative power of
the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting or diminishing
the materials afforded to us by the senses and experience." (Hume, 2.5).

## Paragraph 2: Hume's support of Walker.

Hume's contention that the creative power of the mind stems from applying four basic operations to
pre-existing senses and experiences supports Walker's argument as to the origins of creativity.


## Notes
- Is creativity heritable?

Drive for individuality.
    - Personal identity *is* our individuality and creativity is an expression of such.

Imagination fuels creativity.

What about a photograph of nature, where is the creativity in that?

Creativity would not exist without the creator.

The second law of thermodynamics states that all ordered systems tend towards disorder.
