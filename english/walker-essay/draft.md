# Walker Essay

## Question

What does Alice Walker's essay, "In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens" reveal about the relationship
between ancestry and creativity?

## Introduction

Creativity, responsible for thundering symphonies, impassioned prose, and wondrous works of art, to
name but a few; the Rachmaninoffs, Nabokovs, and Warhols of the world continue to inspire and awe
with their works. The sheer brilliance of their creations begs the question: wherein lies one's
artistry, this *creative spark*?

## Thesis

In her essay, "In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens", Alice Walker argues that the source of
creativity is not a question of nature but of nurture; the *creative spark* found within oneself is
not the product of cosmic coincidence but rather the manifestation of one's upbringing and its
influencing factors.

## Paragraph 1: Walker's Contention

### Topic Sentence

Walker's contention for the origin of creativity is rooted in heredity; she maintains that one's
*creative spark* is passed down, from generation to generation, such that the source of one's
creativity may be found in the teachings and doings of their mother, grandmothers, and other
important figures.

### Body

In her search for answers as to the perseverance of this *creative spark*, Walker finds that

    "our mothers and grandmothers have, more often than not anonymously,
    handed on the creative spark; the seed of the flower they themselves never hoped to see:
    or like a sealed letter they could not plainly read" (674).

Thus cognizance notwithstanding, the influence of one's ancestors on one's own creativity
cannot be discounted.

## Paragraph 2: Historical views on creativity

### Topic Sentence

Perceptions of the concept creativity have been varied throughout history;
philosophers have long debated both its provenance and existence.

### Body

In ancient Greece, there did not exist any words to describe the concept of creativity, or that of
creation itself; according to Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz, Polish philosopher, historian, and member of
the Polish Academy of Sciences, ancient Greek culture did not believe that artists were creators,
instead holding that art was a fascimile of that which may be found in nature (Tatarkiewicz, 244).

This is further demonstrated by the Classical Greek philosopher Plato: "'Will we say of a painter
that he makes something?' asked Plato in *The Republic*, and answered: 'Certainly not, he merely
imitates.'" (qtd. in Tatarkiewicz, 244).

It was not until the Enlightenment Era - during which empiricist philosopher David Hume wrote
on the human mind and creativity in his seminal work,
"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" - that the origins of creativity were explored.

Hume argued that the mind, while seemingly unbounded in its capacity for abstract thought and
imaginings, is in fact limited in its capabilities. Hume asserts that "all this creative power of
the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting or diminishing
the materials afforded to us by the senses and experience." (sec. 2, para. 5).

## Paragraph 3: Hume's support of Walker

### Topic Sentence

Hume's contention that the creative power of the mind stems from applying transformations to
pre-existing sensory and experiential memories supports Walker's argument as to the origins of
creativity.

### Body

In her essay, Walker writes on the determination of her mother on her own life's works:

    Yet so many of the stories I write, that we all write, are my mother's stories...
    that through years of listening to my mother's stories of her life, I have absorbed not only
    the stories themselves, but something of the manner in which she spoke, something of the
    urgency that involves the knowledge that her stories-like her life-must be recorded. It is
    probably for this reason that so much of what I have written is about characters whose
    counterparts in real life are so much older than I am. (674)

Considering the stories and manner in which they were told by Walker's mother to be the "senses and
experience[s]" detailed by Hume, it follows that Walker's own creativity is derived from such
influences. Consequently, the existentialist philosophy presented by Hume lends credence to Walker's
contention that creativity finds its origins in one's ancestry.

## Paragraph 4: Effects of upbringing on creativity

### Topic Sentence

Scientific concensus as to the effect of upbringing on creativity is mixed; while research into the
topic has thus far proven inconclusive, there is compelling evidence to suggest that environmental
factors, such as one's parents, play a major role in determining a person's creative acumen.

### Body

Philip E. Vernon, a British psychologist, writes on "The Nature-Nurture Problem in Creativity" in
the "Handbook of Creativity", a collection of related works in the field. Vernon finds a strong
correlation between siblings and creative ability, where one sibling excels, it is likely that
the other follows (103). Given the common environment shared by siblings during their formative
years, this finding would suggest that such an environment, if not genetic factors, is a
considerable influence on one's future creativity. Root cause notwithstanding, Vernon's finding in
this matter supports Walker's position as to the heredity of creativity.

Furthermore, Vernon continues by examining familial bearing on creativity, exemplified by the Bach
family, in which "from Veit Bach (died 1619) to Johann Christian Bach (died 1782), there is some
information on 60 related males, spanning seven generations. Of these, 53 were well known as
musicians, cantors, and/or organists, many of whom were eminent during their lifetimes" (103).

Considering the dilution and mutation of genes through generations, genetics alone cannot offer a
satisfactory explanation as to the prodigiously musical Bach family. It follows that Walker's
argument for the heredity of creativity through environmental factors
stands to explain this phenomenon; in fostering a creative environment conducive to musical
composition and performance, generations of Bachs passed on the *creative spark* to their progeny.

    - Personal identity *is* our individuality and creativity is an expression of such.

Imagination fuels creativity.

What about a photograph of nature, where is the creativity in that?

Creativity would not exist without the creator.
